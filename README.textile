h1. resource_awareness

resource_awareness makes information about a Rails application's resources (as defined via the 'resource/s' routing DSL methods) available via @Rails.application.resources@. Each resource object encapsulates information such as the resource's name, home route, path and the controller that is handling it:

|_. attribute       |_. example                         |
| id                | post_comments                     |
| name              | comments                          |
| singular_name     | comment                           |
| home_route        | [the 'post_comments' named route] |
| path_prefix       | /posts/:post_id                   |
| path              | /posts/:post_id/comments          |
| prefix_parameters | [:post_id]                        |
| controller_path   | comments                          |

resource_awareness also adds a @resource@ instance method to controllers returning the resource they are handling, if any.

Lastly, resource_awareness adds a @rake resources@ tasks that lists an application's resources, just like @rake routes@ does for routes

Please note that resource_awareness is experimental and the API is likely to change. Please let me know if you have suggestions or comments!
